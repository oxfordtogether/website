            - If you think an individual just needs to have a helpful neighbour,
            you can find a street champion in the area via the website{" "}
            <a
              href="https://oxfordtogether.org/postcode-lookup/"

              postcode lookup
            </a>
            . This will connect you with someone very local, who can offer
            support (not necessarily a DBS checked individual). Where there
            isnâ€™t a street champion locally, we will triage centrally and find a
            non DBS or DBS checked person (depending on the query)
          </p>
          <p>
            - If the referral is higher need or complex, you can send a
            practical support referral{" "}

              form
            </a>{" "}
            and we can allocate a DBS checked volunteer (but this will be slower
            as we only want to use people very locally to minimise travel and we
            need to build up more coverage across the City)
          </p>
          <p>
            - If the person is generally anxious or just needs a friendly check
            in, refer for{" "}

            and they will get a regular call (up to daily if desired) to share
            info, say hi, and a bit of social time.
